## 📊 Financial Operations Dashboard (Sample)

### Overview
This repository contains a sample financial operations dashboard developed to analyze electronic funds transfer (EFT) payment activity across departments and insurance payers. The dashboard focuses on identifying process inefficiencies, comparing automated versus manual payment workflows, and supporting data-informed operational decision-making.

Due to confidentiality requirements, all data displayed has been anonymized and aggregated. While values and identifiers have been modified, the structure, logic, and analytical approach reflect real operational use in a higher-education healthcare environment.

### Purpose
The dashboard was designed to support:
- Identification of departments and payers with high volumes of manual payment processing
- Comparison of automated vs. manual EFT adoption by department and payer
- Detection of workflow inefficiencies and potential cost-saving opportunities
- Leadership decision-making related to process improvement, staffing prioritization, and automation

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
  - Pivot tables and advanced formulas
  - Data standardization and validation
  - Dashboard layout and visualization
- PDF export for distribution to non-technical stakeholders

### Key Takeaways
- Manual payment processing remains concentrated among specific payers and departments
- Increased adoption of automated EFT workflows presents opportunities to reduce processing time and operational risk
- Aggregated dashboards provide leadership with quick visibility into efficiency gaps without exposing sensitive data

### Notes on Data Privacy
This project intentionally excludes confidential, patient-level, or institutionally sensitive data. All figures are presented at an aggregated level to demonstrate analytical thinking, dashboard design, and decision-support capability rather than exact financial results.
